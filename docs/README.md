# Welcome to the **Semantic Telemetry** Project
The Semantic Telemetry project is an effort towards building an open, decoupled, technology-neutral, and semantic-based telemetry architecture.

## Initial Thoughts
> The overriding design goal for semantic telemetry is to annotate the measurements using 
> an open ontology to improve understandability, interoperability, and inference.
> The idea is to decouple the components as much as possible to allow them to evolve independently, 
> while interacting with other components via semantic measurement records.
